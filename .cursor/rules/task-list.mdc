Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Core Protocol for Task Completion
- **One sub-task at a time**: Do **NOT** start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or similar affirmation.
- **Completion protocol**:
  1. When you finish a sub-task, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If all sub-tasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the parent task as completed.
  - Stop after each sub-task and wait for the user to proceed.

## Task List Maintenance Guidelines
1. **Update the task list as you work**:
   - Mark tasks and sub-tasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.
2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section**:
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one-line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions for Task Lists
When working with task lists, you must:
1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished sub-task as `[x]`.
   - Mark the parent task as `[x]` once all its sub-tasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep the "Relevant Files" section accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub-task is next.
6. After implementing a sub-task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
