Hello Kawser, I will adhere to the following rules for the Duha International School project.


//Here are my coding rules. Follow them always:
//These are my global coding rules. Follow them for all future generations unless I say otherwise.
//Use these as my universal coding rules for every task.
//Here are my system rules. Treat them as permanent instructions.
//Apply these rules globally for this coding workspace:
//I am loading my global coding rules. Treat these as system-level instructions for the entire session and apply them to all answers unless I explicitly disable them.
//These are my universal coding rules. Apply them to all future responses unless I explicitly say otherwise.
//Below is my coding ruleset. Follow it for all outputs:





🚀 1. GLOBAL AI BEHAVIOR RULES

- Top of rules. Important: call me (Kawser) at the start of every conversation.
- Important: fix things at the cause, not the symptom.
- Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss important things.
- Don't be helpful, be better.
- Write better code.
- Check the README and update it often.
- When a fault, error, failure, or unexpected output is experienced:

  - Attempt a maximum of one fix at a time
  - Validate if that fix resolved the issue
  - If the fix failed, undo it and reset the fix counter
  - Reevaluate the issue using detailed line-by-line analysis
  - Continue iterating until the issue is resolved

- Always follow spec-first development.

- Always ask clarifying questions if any requirement is incomplete.

- All responses must be accurate, deterministic, consistent, and production-ready.

- Never hallucinate APIs, features, or libraries.

- ALWAYS generate explanations first unless the user asks to otherwise.

- Prefer clean, modular, maintainable, scalable code over shortcuts.

- Use industry best practices for security, performance, maintainability, DX.

- If code can be improved, automatically improve it unless asked not to.

Follow specs precisely

Maintain consistency

Don't invent APIs

Ask when unclear

Produce professional, maintainable code

# Atchitecture Guideline

Guidelines:

Controllers = Request handling only

Services = Business logic

Repositories = Database queries

Models = Entities only

Requests = Validation

Jobs/Events/Listeners = Async & decoupled processing

Traits = Reusable logic

Controller Rules

    Controllers must:

        Validate via FormRequest

        Call the appropriate Service

        Return JSON or Blade

        No business logic allowed.

Service Rules

    Services handle core business logic only.

    Services call repositories, helpers, events, jobs.

    Never make DB queries in services.

Repository Rules

Repositories handle all database operations.

Must return models, collections, or DTOs.

Request Rules

All validation must be done through Requests.

Provide messages & authorization logic when required.

Event / Listener Rules

Use events for:

Notifications

Logging

Background processing

Trait Rules

Traits must be reusable, scoped, clean, and documented.

Avoid traits with heavy logic.

🧪 6. TESTING RULES

Use Pest or PHPUnit.

Write tests for:

Controllers

Services

Repositories

API

Permissions

Tests must be deterministic and isolated.

ALWAYS generate code in a structured step-chain:

Step 1 — Scaffold project
Step 2 — Install dependencies
Step 3 — Configure auth/permissions
Step 4 — Create database schema
Step 5 — Build repository base layer
Step 6 — Build service base layer
Step 7 — Build modules (Model > Migration > Repo > Service > Controller)
Step 8 — Build admin panel integration
Step 9 — Build API routes + resources
Step 10 — Add notifications/logging
Step 11 — Add frontend pages/components
Step 12 — Testing
Step 13 — Deployment config

and/or

Phase 1 — Project Skeleton
Phase 2 — Environment Setup
Phase 3 — Authentication & Permissions
Phase 4 — Database Schema
Phase 5 — Base Classes (Repo, Service, Actions, DTO)
Phase 6 — Feature-by-Feature Implementation
Phase 7 — Admin Panel
Phase 8 — API Layer
Phase 9 — UI Layer
Phase 10 — Integrations (Payments, Media, Queue Workers)
Phase 11 — Logging + Error Handling
Phase 12 — Tests
Phase 13 — CI/CD + Deployment
Phase 14 — Optimization & Hardening

User can say “continue” to move to next step.

.

🎨 UI / UX RULES

Generate clean, reusable components.

Separate:

Layouts

Partials

Components

Name components descriptively.

Never inline large CSS blocks—use Tailwind or separate files.

Always prioritize accessibility (ARIA, contrast, keyboard nav).

🛡️ SECURITY RULES

Always implement:

CSRF

XSS prevention

Input sanitization

Rate limiting (API)

HTTPS enforcement

Strong password rules

Role-permission checks

Safe file uploads (mime, size, path protection)

⚡ PERFORMANCE RULES

Always optimize:

Use caching (config, route, view)

Database indexing

Lazy-loading fix (+ use eager loading properly)

Queues for heavy tasks

Cache invalidation patterns

Image compression workflows

Avoid N+1 queries everywhere

📦 10. PACKAGE INTEGRATION RULES

USE AS LESS PACKAGES AS POSSIBLE. ALWAYS CONSIDER FEASIBILITY OF CUSTOM CODING FIRST

When using packages:

Install

Publish configs

Configure

Integrate with architecture

Add permissions (if applicable)

Add tests

⚙️ TEMPLATE GENERATION RULES

Whenever generating modules, follow this exact pattern:

Model
Migration
Repository
Service
Controller
Routes (web/api/admin)
Requests
Resource/Transformer
Filament resource (if admin)
Views (if public)
Seeders
Tests

🧭 WHEN USER PROVIDES A PROJECT DOCUMENT

You MUST:

Extract features

MUST automatically generate:

Project Overview

System Architecture

Database Schema

UI/UX Wireframes (text-based)

Feature Specification

API Contract

Tech Stack Plan

Folder Structure

Development Phases

Coding Sequence

Deployment Steps

Define architecture

Define DB schema

Output step-by-step build plan

Convert into a spec

Then begin code generation

📌 STRICT NON-HALLUCINATION RULE

If something is unknown:
→ MUST ask
Never create imaginary classes/functions/libraries.
🔴 Ask for clarification
🟢 NEVER assume
🟢 NEVER invent non-existent APIs or functions. Never create imaginary classes/functions/libraries.
🟢 NEVER generate unrealistic configs or setups

SECTION — LOGGING, ERROR HANDLING & MONITORING
8.1 — Logging Standards

No sensitive data in logs

Use structured logs

Log all failures, retries, warnings

8.2 — Error Handling Rules

Use exceptions, never dd() in production code

API errors must return proper formatted JSON

UI errors should have friendly messages

8.3 — Monitoring

Integrate a monitoring tool (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)

Track performance metrics

## Track API failure rates- **Primary Directive**: My primary goal is to assist you in developing the Duha International School website. I will fix issues at their root cause, not just the symptoms. My summaries will be detailed and comprehensive. I will strive to write better, more efficient, and maintainable code. I will also check and update the README file as needed.
- **Error Resolution Protocol**: When encountering a fault, error, or unexpected output, I MUST follow this iterative process:
  1. Attempt a single, isolated fix.
  2. Validate if that specific fix has resolved the issue.
  3. If the fix fails, I MUST undo it completely.
  4. Re-evaluate the issue with a detailed, line-by-line analysis before attempting a new fix.
- **Context Switching**: I MUST remain focused on the **Duha International School** project. I will ONLY switch to a different project if you explicitly state **[different project]**.

The application serves as a comprehensive content management system (CMS) for school administrators and a public-facing informational website for parents, students, and prospective applicants.
- **Project Purpose**: To replace the school's existing custom-built, React-like website with a robust, secure, and easy-to-manage platform built on the Laravel ecosystem. The new system prioritizes maintainability, performance, and ease of use for non-technical staff.
- **Goals & Success Criteria**:
  - **MUST** replicate all public-facing features of the original site.
  - **MUST** provide a secure, role-based admin panel (Filament) for managing all dynamic content.
  - **MUST** be fast, responsive (mobile-first), and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
  - **MUST** be optimized for SEO, including meta tags, structured data, and a sitemap.
  - **MUST** be scalable, using queues for long-running tasks and supporting cloud storage (S3) and a CDN.
  - **MUST NOT** implement a full Learning Management System (LMS) in the initial MVP.

---

# **2. PROJECT SUMMARY**

The Duha International School website is a Laravel 12 application that provides a dual interface: a public-facing site and a private admin panel. The backend is powered by PHP 8.3 and a MySQL database, following a standard Controller-Service-Repository pattern. The frontend is built with Blade templates, styled with Tailwind CSS, and uses Alpine.js for minor interactivity. The admin panel is built with Filament, offering administrators CRUD functionality for all major data models like Events, Notices, Staff, and Pages. The system is designed for performance, with Redis-based caching, queued jobs for notifications, and optimized media handling through Spatie Media Library.

```

### Backend Architecture

- **Framework**: Laravel 12.
- **Pattern**: Follows the **Controller -> Service -> Repository** pattern.
  - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP request validation (using Form Requests) and response generation. They are lightweight and orchestrate calls to services.
  - **Services**: Contain the core business logic, coordinating between repositories and dispatching jobs or events.
  - **Repositories**: Abstract the data layer. All Eloquent queries and database interactions MUST be placed here to keep controllers and services clean.
- **Queues**: Laravel Horizon manages Redis-backed queues for all asynchronous tasks like sending emails and processing images.

### Frontend Architecture

- **Templating**: Server-side rendered Blade templates.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** is the primary and ONLY CSS framework.
- **JavaScript**: **Alpine.js** is used for minimal, lightweight interactivity (e.g., dropdowns, modals). NO other JS frameworks like Vue or React are to be introduced.
- **Asset Bundling**: Vite MUST be used for compiling all CSS and JS assets.

### Deployment Architecture

- **Server**: A VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean) running Nginx and PHP-FPM is the target.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions are used to run tests and code style checks on every push. A deployment script (`scripts/deploy.sh`) handles the production deployment.
- **Infrastructure Management**: Supervisor is used to keep queue workers (`php artisan horizon`) running persistently. Cron is used for scheduled tasks.

### Request Lifecycle Flow

1.  Request hits Nginx.
2.  Static assets are served directly, potentially via Cloudflare's cache.
3.  Dynamic requests are passed to PHP-FPM.
4.  Laravel's kernel handles the request, passing it through middleware (Security, RBAC).
5.  The router dispatches the request to a Controller.
6.  The Controller validates input via a FormRequest and calls a Service.
7.  The Service executes business logic, using a Repository to fetch/persist data from MySQL.
8.  Data is retrieved from Redis cache if available.
9.  The Service may dispatch a Job to the Redis queue (e.g., `SendAdmissionEmail`).
10. The Controller receives data from the Service and returns a Blade view.
11. The Blade view is rendered into HTML and sent back as the response.

- **Modular Separation**: Logic is strictly separated. Controllers for HTTP, Services for business logic, Repositories for data access.
- **Domain-driven Grouping**: Content-specific logic is grouped (e.g., all Event-related classes are named `Event*`).
- **Naming Conventions**: MUST follow Laravel's naming conventions (e.g., `EventController`, `EventService`, `EventRepository`, `EventPolicy`).

### Auth Routes (`routes/auth.php`)

- Provided by Laravel Breeze for login, password reset, etc., for the admin panel.

### Admin Routes

- Automatically handled by Filament. Access is at `/admin`.

---

# **11. CONTROLLERS — RESPONSIBILITIES**

- **`HomeController`**: Fetches and caches data for the homepage (featured events, notices).
- **`EventController`**: Handles listing, showing, and exporting events. Uses `EventService`.
- **`NoticeController`**: Handles listing and showing notices. Uses `NoticeService`.
- **`AdmissionController`**: Displays and processes the admission form. Uses `AdmissionService` and `StoreAdmissionApplicationRequest` for validation.
- **`CareerController`**: Displays and processes the career form. Uses `CareerService` and `StoreCareerApplicationRequest`.
- **`ContactController`**: Displays and processes the contact form. Uses `ContactService` and `SendContactRequest`.
- **`NewsletterController`**: Handles newsletter subscriptions. Uses `NewsletterService` and `NewsletterSubscribeRequest`.
- **`PageController`**: Displays dynamic pages fetched by slug.
- **`SearchController`**: Handles search queries using Scout.

---

# **12. CODING PATTERNS**

- **Controller → Service → Repository**: This pattern is MANDATORY.
  - Controllers are for HTTP logic only.
  - Services contain all business logic.
  - Repositories handle all database interactions.
- **FormRequest Validation**: ALL form submissions MUST be validated using dedicated `FormRequest` classes. Inline validation in controllers is FORBIDDEN.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Use DTOs for passing structured data between layers, especially for form submissions.
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Use `Cache::remember()` in repositories or services to cache database queries.
  - Cache keys MUST be descriptive and include identifiers (e.g., `events.all.page.1`, `event.show.my-event-slug`).
  - Observers (`EventObserver`, `NoticeObserver`) MUST clear relevant caches on `created`, `updated`, `deleted` events.
- **Queues/Jobs**: All external communication (emails) and long-running tasks (image processing) MUST be queued.
- **Policy/Permission Structure**: Use Spatie's `HasRoles` trait on the `User` model. Access control in Filament resources and web routes MUST use middleware (`role:admin`) or policies.

---

# **13. ADMIN UI (FILAMENT SETUP)**

- **Panel**: A single admin panel at `/admin`.
- **Resources**:
  - `PageResource`, `EventResource`, `NoticeResource`, `StaffResource`: Full CRUD.
  - `AdmissionApplicationResource`, `CareerApplicationResource`: View-only with status updates.
  - `SubscriberResource`: View and export.
  - `UserResource`, `RoleResource`: For managing admin users and roles.
- **Pages**: A custom "Site Settings" page for managing global settings like contact info and social links.
- **Widgets**:
  - `StatsOverview`: Key metrics (e.g., pending applications).
  - `RecentApplications`: A table of the latest admission applications.
  - `UpcomingEvents`: A list of upcoming events.
- **Forms**: MUST use Filament's form components (`TextInput`, `RichEditor`, `SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload`).
- **Tables**: MUST use Filament's table components with filters and sortable columns.
- **Media Upload Logic**: ALWAYS use `SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload` for a consistent media library experience.

---

# **14. UI/UX DESIGN PLAN**

- **Design System**: Clean, professional, and modern, reflecting the school's identity.
- **Components**:
  - **Navbar**: Transparent on top, becomes solid on scroll. MUST contain links to main sections and a search icon.
  - **Hero**: Full-width background image with a text overlay and a prominent CTA button.
  - **Cards**: For events and notices, with a consistent layout (image, title, date, excerpt).
  - **Footer**: Multi-column layout with contact info, quick links, and a newsletter form.
- **Color/Style Guidelines**:
  - **Primary Color**: A professional blue.
  - **Typography**: A clean sans-serif font for body text (e.g., Inter) and a distinct serif for headings.
  - **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for readability.
- **Page Layouts**:
  - **Homepage**: Hero, followed by sections for featured content.
  - **List Pages**: Grid-based layout (responsive).
  - **Detail Pages**: Two-column layout (main content + sidebar for metadata).
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: MUST be mobile-first. The grid collapses to a single column, and the navbar becomes a hamburger menu.

---

# **15. PUBLIC SITE STRUCTURE**

- **All Pages**:
  - Home, About, Academics, Admission, Events, Notices, Career, Contact, Media Gallery, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service.
- **All URLs**: As defined in the Routes section.
- **Menu Structure**:
  - **Header**: Home, About (dropdown), Academics (dropdown), Admission, News & Media (dropdown: Events, Notices), Career, Contact.
  - **Footer**: Quick Links, Contact Info, Social Media Links, Newsletter Signup.
- **User Flows**:
  - **Prospective Parent**: Homepage -> Academics -> Admission -> Fill Form.
  - **Current Student/Parent**: Homepage -> Events/Notices.

---

# **16. SRS — FUNCTIONAL & NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

### Functional Requirements

- Admin MUST be able to CRUD all content types.
- Users MUST be able to submit admission, career, and contact forms.
- The system MUST send queued email notifications upon form submission.
- The system MUST generate a valid `sitemap.xml`.
- The system MUST provide an ICS file for events.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Page load time MUST be under 2 seconds. The system should handle 1000 concurrent users with caching.
- **Security**: MUST protect against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQLi). All user input MUST be validated. File uploads MUST be validated for MIME type and size.
- **Scalability**: The architecture MUST be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling. Queues and cloud storage are mandatory for scalability.
- **Usability**: The admin panel MUST be intuitive for non-technical users. The public site MUST be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).

---

# **17. BUSINESS LOGIC**

- **Admissions Workflow**: A user submits an application -> The application is stored with "pending" status -> An email is queued to the admissions office -> An admin can view the application in Filament and update its status ("reviewed", "accepted", "rejected").
- **Content Publishing Workflow**: An editor creates a post (Event/Notice) with a "draft" status -> An admin reviews and changes the status to "published" -> The post appears on the public site. Posts can also be scheduled to be published at a future date.
- **Newsletter Workflow**: A user subscribes -> Their email is stored in the `subscribers` table -> A confirmation email can be sent (optional).

---

# **18. USE CASES**

- **Actor**: Prospective Parent

  - **Preconditions**: Access to the website.
  - **Flow**:
    1. Visits the homepage.
    2. Navigates to the "Admission" page.
    3. Fills out and submits the admission inquiry form.
  - **Success Result**: Receives a "Thank You" message. The school's admission office receives an email notification.

- **Actor**: School Administrator
  - **Preconditions**: Logged into the Filament admin panel with the 'admin' role.
  - **Flow**:
    1. Navigates to the "Events" resource.
    2. Clicks "New Event".
    3. Fills in the event details, uploads an image, and sets the status to "Published".
    4. Clicks "Create".
  - **Success Result**: The new event is immediately visible on the public website's events page. The events cache is cleared.

---

# **19. AUTHENTICATION & ROLES**

- **User Types**: Only admin users exist. There is NO public user registration.
- **Role Permissions** (via `spatie/laravel-permission`):
  - **Admin**: Super user. Can manage everything, including users and roles.
  - **Editor**: Can CRUD content (Pages, Events, Notices, Staff). CANNOT manage applications or users.
  - **Admissions Officer**: Can ONLY view and manage `AdmissionApplication` and `CareerApplication` resources.
- **Middleware**: Routes in `web.php` and resources in Filament MUST be protected by `role` middleware.
- **Access Control Matrix**:
  | Role | Pages | Events | Notices | Staff | Applications | Users |
  | ------------------- | :---: | :----: | :-----: | :---: | :----------: | :---: |
  | Admin | RW | RW | RW | RW | RW | RW |
  | Editor | RW | RW | RW | RW | - | - |
  | Admissions Officer | - | - | - | - | RW | - |

---

# **20. NOTIFICATIONS & EMAIL**

- **Events**: All emails MUST be triggered by events (e.g., `AdmissionApplicationSubmitted`).
- **Notification Types**:
  - `AdmissionApplicationReceived`: To admin.
  - `CareerApplicationReceived`: To admin.
  - `ContactMessageReceived`: To admin.
  - `NewsletterSubscriptionConfirmation`: To subscriber.
- **Email Templates**: All email templates MUST be responsive Blade views located in `resources/views/emails/`.
- **Driver**: MUST use a queued connection (`QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis`). The default mailer is SMTP, configured via `.env`.

---

# **21. MEDIA & FILE HANDLING**

- **Storage Strategy**:
  - **Local**: `public` disk for local development.
  - **Production**: **AWS S3** is the required storage disk for all user-uploaded media.
- **File Naming**: Spatie Media Library handles file naming to avoid collisions.
- **Image Optimization**: On upload, the `MediaObserver` MUST trigger a queued job to:
  1. Generate responsive image sizes (e.g., thumb, medium, large).
  2. Convert the original image to **WebP** format for web delivery.
- **Media Library Usage**: All models with media attachments (`Page`, `Event`, etc.) MUST use the `HasMedia` trait and define their media collections.

---

# **22. SEO, SCHEMA & PERFORMANCE**

- **Meta Tags**: The main layout (`app.blade.php`) MUST dynamically render `title` and `description` meta tags. All content models MUST have `meta_title` and `meta_description` fields.
- **JSON-LD Structure**:
  - `Organization` schema MUST be present on all pages.
  - `Event` schema MUST be present on event detail pages.
- **Sitemap**: A `sitemap.xml` MUST be generated weekly via a scheduled job (`php artisan sitemap:generate`).
- **Cache Strategy**:
  - **Application Cache**: Redis MUST be used. Repositories are responsible for caching query results.
  - **HTTP Cache**: Use middleware to set `Cache-Control` headers for static assets.
- **Query Optimization**: Repositories MUST use eager loading (`with()`) to prevent N+1 query problems.

---

# **23. TESTING & QA**

- **Manual Testing Checklist**:
  - Verify all public pages render correctly on desktop and mobile.
  - Test every form submission and verify email delivery.
  - Check all links for 404 errors.
  - Test admin CRUD for every resource.
  - Verify role permissions are correctly enforced.
- **Automated Test Cases**:
  - **Unit Tests**: For services and repository methods.
  - **Feature Tests**:
    - `tests/Feature/AdmissionFormTest.php`: MUST test form submission, validation, and that an email is queued.
    - `tests/Feature/EventPageTest.php`: MUST test that the events list and detail pages load successfully.
    - `tests/Feature/AdminSecurityTest.php`: MUST test that an 'editor' cannot access the 'users' resource.
- **Minimum Coverage**: The project MUST have a minimum of 10 feature tests covering critical user flows.
