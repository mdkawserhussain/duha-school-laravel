**In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.**
All praise is due to Allah, who created us as human beings and honored us with
the role of His representatives on earth. May endless peace and blessings be
upon our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), who
illuminated our lives with the guidance of truth, wisdom, and goodness.
At Duha International School, we firmly believe that knowledge is a sacred trust
from Allah. He has elevated humankind through intellect and learning, guiding us
through the light of the Divine Book — the Qur’an. Inspired by this eternal
guidance, we have built the foundation of our education on the essence of Divine
knowledge.
Our motto, **“Build the Nation with the Light of Divine Knowledge,”** reflects our
mission to nurture a generation grounded in faith, enriched with knowledge, and
empowered to lead with integrity.
We aspire to develop our students into successful individuals — both in this world
and the Hereafter. To achieve this, we emphasize a balanced approach that
cultivates the mind, body, and soul. Alongside strong moral and spiritual
education, our curriculum integrates both national and international standards.
Our students engage in modern learning experiences such as science
experiments, problem-solving, public speaking, coding, and AI — ensuring they are
equipped with the skills needed for the future while remaining rooted in Islamic
values.
Our vision is to raise productive, confident, and conscientious young Muslims
who will bring prosperity and positive change to their families, society, nation,
and the entire Ummah.
We warmly welcome you to join us in this noble journey of learning, faith, and
excellence.

“Our foundation is morality. Our goal is leadership."
Welcome to Duha International school--a place where we believe
that a truly excellent education is built on a strong foundation of
morality and character. While academic achievement is vital, we
know that to succeed in the wider world, our students need
more than just good grades; they need a well-developed moral
compass.
At DIS, we intentionally weave the teaching of core values into
every aspect of school life, from the classroom to the sports
field. Our focus is on cultivating traits that matter most: integrity,
empathy, respect, responsibility, and perseverance. We are not
just teaching students what to think, but how to be thoughtful,
ethical, and engaged members of their community.
We believe that moral education is the bedrock of leadership. By
fostering an environment where students learn to make
principled decisions, treat others with kindness, and own their
actions, we are preparing them to be confident, contributing
citizens and the compassionate leaders of tomorrow.
Choosing a school is choosing a culture. If you seek a supportive
community where your child's character will be nurtured with
the same dedication as their intellectual growth, we invite you to
join us. We look forward to partnering with you in this most
important endeavor of shaping great minds and good hearts.
